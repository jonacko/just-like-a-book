## 1. Summary

This project was undertaken as a submission for a Birmingham University Bootcamp assignment, with a brief to create a README generator using the Inquirere package in Node.js.  The user story and acceptance criteria are below:

## 2. Key features:

- user input accepted to generate a professional README file
- title, contents section and all other relevant sections displayed on generation
- information added on user input; user is prompted to add information if blank
- lisence badge displayed depending on user selection; if 'none' selected returns an empty string
- clickable links for GitHub username & email address


## 3. Issues encountered/further amendments

As far as I understand, all acceptance criteria are met.  However if I were to develop this readme generator further, I would add the following features:

- prompt to add an image file to display the application
- 'checkbox' to display list of technologies used
